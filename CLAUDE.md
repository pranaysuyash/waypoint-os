## Projects-Level Agent Alignment (Workspace Memory)

**Purpose:** ensure any agent/LLM (Codex, Copilot, Claude Code, Qwen, GLM, etc.) starts aligned with the same workspace memory + project context.

### Step 0 (first time in this folder)
Generate the per-project context pack:
```bash
/Users/pranay/Projects/agent-start
```

### Step 1 (per shell)
Load the shared defaults for this project session:
```bash
source Docs/context/agent-start/STEP1_ENV.sh
# Or (no file read) print exports and eval:
/Users/pranay/Projects/agent-start --print-step1 --skip-index
```

### Step 2 (generate aligned context pack)
```bash
/Users/pranay/Projects/agent-start
```

Outputs:
- Canonical project-local pack:
  - `Docs/context/agent-start/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`
  - `Docs/context/agent-start/AGENT_KICKOFF_PROMPT.txt`
  - `Docs/context/agent-start/STEP1_ENV.sh`
- Compatibility mirrors when present:
  - `.agent/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`
  - `.agent/AGENT_KICKOFF_PROMPT.txt`
  - `.agent/STEP1_ENV.sh`
  - `frontend/docs/context/agent-start/*`

### Automation (already configured)
- Terminal auto-loads `Docs/context/agent-start/STEP1_ENV.sh` when you `cd` into a project under `/Users/pranay/Projects` (zsh hook).
- VS Code/Antigravity can run `agent-start --skip-index` on folder open via `.vscode/tasks.json`.

### How agents should use this
- Provide the canonical `Docs/context/agent-start/AGENT_KICKOFF_PROMPT.txt` and `Docs/context/agent-start/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` as the first context for the agent.
- If sources conflict, the agent must cite concrete file paths and ask before proceeding.
- If the canonical context pack is missing or stale, run `/Users/pranay/Projects/agent-start --skip-index` before planning changes.
- Treat `.agent/` files as compatibility mirrors only.
- Do not start implementation until `Docs/context/agent-start/AGENT_KICKOFF_PROMPT.txt` and `Docs/context/agent-start/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` are loaded.

### Mandatory agent operating mandate
- Begin every substantial task by refreshing ground truth: read the applicable instruction stack, repo-local `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, and any Qwen, Codex, Copilot, or other agent-specific instruction files relevant to the repo.
- Check the current codebase, docs, worklogs, and project status before planning or coding. Parallel agents may have changed files, decisions, or docs since the last session.
- Treat drift as normal: before editing and again before finalizing, re-check the files and docs you rely on, then adapt rather than assuming older context still holds.
- Use relevant skills and workflow guidance after checking the configured skill locations. Do not default to one toolset when a better domain skill exists.
- Think from first principles and optimize for long-term, scalable, architecturally sound solutions. Existing code is evidence, not a boundary; if current implementation no longer fits the product reality or architecture, propose or implement the proper path.
- Avoid building duplicate or parallel systems. Extend canonical routes, pipelines, validation, docs, and tools unless the project explicitly calls for a new replacement path.
- Git safety: read-only git inspection is allowed; no destructive commands, staging, commits, pushes, resets, or checkouts without explicit permission in the current conversation.
- Research online when facts may be current, external, or uncertain; cite sources when research affects decisions.
- Test changes, verify for regressions, and document findings, decisions, open questions, and follow-up work in durable project artifacts.

### Mandatory commit gate
Install or refresh the managed repo-local git hooks. They resolve the repo's effective hook path, block commit creation in `prepare-commit-msg` until the current full `motto_v3.md` has a fresh attestation, then enforce objective diff checks plus commit trailers in `pre-commit` and `commit-msg`:
```bash
python3 /Users/pranay/Projects/workspace_memory/scripts/install_git_precommit_agent_hook.py
```

Refresh the current repo's motto attestation before committing:
```bash
python3 /Users/pranay/Projects/workspace_memory/scripts/attest_motto.py --repo "$PWD"
```

### Shared Idea Pad Protocol (Required)
- Canonical file: `/Users/pranay/Projects/idea_pad/IDEA_PAD.md`
- Raw capture file: `/Users/pranay/Projects/idea_pad/IDEA_DUMP.md`
- Do not create per-model primary copies of the idea pad.
- Do not overwrite the whole file; use append/update workflow with validation.
- Capture rough ideas in `IDEA_DUMP.md`, then promote high-signal items into `IDEA_PAD.md`.
- Before edits:
```bash
python3 /Users/pranay/Projects/idea_pad/scripts/idea_pad_tool.py validate
```
- Add new ideas safely:
```bash
python3 /Users/pranay/Projects/idea_pad/scripts/idea_pad_tool.py add --title "<title>" --owner "<agent>" --type build
```
- After updates, refresh shared memory index:
```bash
cd /Users/pranay/Projects
./projects-memory index
```

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming -> invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors -> invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR -> invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs -> invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff -> invoke review
- Update docs after shipping -> invoke document-release
- Weekly retro -> invoke retro
- Design system, brand -> invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish -> invoke design-review
- Architecture review -> invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, "save my work" -> invoke context-save
- Resume, restore, "where was I" -> invoke context-restore
- Code quality, health check -> invoke health
